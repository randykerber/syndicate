# Warp Terminal - System-Level AI Actor

## Overview
Warp is a Rust-based terminal with integrated AI capabilities, providing system-level control and autonomous workflow execution. With your Pro subscription, it offers the most powerful system access in the SSS ecosystem.

## Current Status
- **Subscription**: Warp Pro active
- **AI Model**: Claude 4 Sonnet (default), can switch to OpenAI o3, Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Request Limits**: 500 requests/month + pay-as-you-go overages
- **Integration Status**: Ready for MCP integration

## Core Capabilities

### AI Agent Modes
- **Command Generation**: Natural language → shell commands
- **Agent Mode**: Autonomous multi-step workflows with permission gates
- **Active AI**: Proactive error detection and fix suggestions
- **Voice Commands**: Voice interaction for terminal operations

### System Access
- **Unlimited Scope**: Can execute any terminal command (with user approval)
- **File Operations**: Read, write, manipulate any accessible file
- **Package Management**: Homebrew, npm, pip, etc.
- **Git Operations**: Full version control automation
- **Infrastructure**: AWS, cloud services, CI/CD automation

### Security Model
- **Permission-Based**: All AI commands require user approval
- **Zero Data Retention**: No storage of terminal I/O on Warp servers
- **Secret Redaction**: Automatic protection of API keys and sensitive data
- **Direct API**: Data passes directly to AI providers without Warp interference

## MCP Integration

### Native MCP Support
Warp includes built-in MCP server support for external integrations:

```json
{
  "GitHub": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": ["run", "-i", "--rm", "-e", "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN", "ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server"],
    "env": {"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<token>"},
    "start_on_launch": false
  }
}
```

### Available MCP Servers
- **GitHub**: Repository management, PR automation
- **Grafana**: Monitoring and dashboard integration  
- **Linear**: Ticket management
- **Vercel**: Deployment automation
- **Custom**: Any MCP server can be configured

## Integration Strategy for SSS

### As System Controller
- **File System Operations**: Bulk file processing, vault maintenance
- **Cross-App Automation**: System-level glue between applications
- **Development Workflows**: Code generation, testing, deployment
- **Data Processing**: Log analysis, batch operations

### MCP Bridge Opportunities
```typescript
// Example: Warp as MCP client calling our custom servers
const warpMCPConfig = {
  "sss-reminders": {
    "command": "node",
    "args": ["/path/to/syndicate-js/dist/mcp-servers/reminders-server.js"],
    "start_on_launch": true
  },
  "sss-drafts": {
    "command": "node", 
    "args": ["/path/to/syndicate-js/dist/mcp-servers/drafts-server.js"],
    "start_on_launch": true
  }
};
```

### Voice Integration
- **SuperWhisper → Warp**: Voice commands for system operations
- **Warp → Actions**: AI-generated commands for file/system tasks
- **Multi-Step Workflows**: "Process all drafts from last week and organize by project"

## Architectural Role

### In the SSS Ecosystem
```
Human Voice Input → SuperWhisper → Warp AI → System Commands
                               ↓
                          MCP Protocol
                               ↓
                      Custom MCP Servers → Apps (Drafts, Obsidian, etc.)
```

### Unique Advantages
1. **System-Level Access**: Can control anything on the system
2. **AI Native**: Built-in AI capabilities, not bolted on
3. **MCP Ready**: Native protocol support for external integration
4. **Permission Model**: Safe autonomous operation with user gates
5. **Multi-Agent**: Can run multiple AI workflows simultaneously

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Basic Integration
- [ ] Configure Warp MCP for filesystem server
- [ ] Test voice → Warp → command execution workflow
- [ ] Verify permission model works for SSS use cases

### Phase 2: Custom MCP Servers
- [ ] Build reminders MCP server accessible from Warp
- [ ] Create drafts processing MCP server
- [ ] Integrate with existing Raycast workflows

### Phase 3: Advanced Workflows
- [ ] Multi-step document processing pipelines
- [ ] Cross-vault content organization
- [ ] Automated backup and sync operations

## Security Considerations
- **User Approval Required**: All system commands need explicit permission
- **Audit Trail**: Log all Warp AI operations for security review
- **Scope Limiting**: Consider restricted environments for sensitive operations
- **API Key Management**: Leverage Warp's secret redaction capabilities

## Performance Notes
- **Rust-Based**: Exceptionally fast terminal performance
- **Context Limits**: Large context windows for complex operations
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agent workflows can run simultaneously
- **Benchmark**: #1 on Terminal-Bench (52% score)
