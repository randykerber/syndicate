# Multi-Model Integration - Future Consideration

## Decision: Deferred for Later
**Date**: Current session  
**Reason**: Focus on learning agentic systems with OpenAI Agent SDK first, add multi-model later

## Key Libraries Identified

### mcp-use
- **npm**: `mcp-use` and `@mcp-use/cli`
- **Capabilities**: Connect any LLM (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Groq) to MCP servers
- **Built on**: LangChain for model abstraction
- **Issue**: ES modules vs our CommonJS project

### Value Proposition
- **Cost optimization**: Use cheap models for simple tasks, expensive for complex
- **Capability matching**: Claude for reasoning, GPT for function calling, Groq for speed
- **Vendor flexibility**: Not locked to OpenAI pricing/policies

## Implementation Notes for Future

### When to Revisit
- After mastering basic agentic patterns with OpenAI
- When cost optimization becomes important
- When specific model capabilities are needed (Claude reasoning, etc.)

### Integration Strategy
Either:
1. **Convert project to ES modules** to use mcp-use directly
2. **Use mcp-use CLI** for testing different models
3. **Build abstraction layer** over multiple model APIs
