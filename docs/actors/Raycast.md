- **Manage MCP Servers**: Server configuration and management
- **Server Discovery**: Built-in registry for finding MCP servers

### MCP Configuration Format
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/mcp-server-filesystem",
      "args": ["/Users/rk/gh/randykerber"]
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "/usr/local/bin/mcp-server-sequential-thinking"
    },
    "custom-reminders": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/syndicate-js/dist/mcp-servers/reminders-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Voice Integration Architecture

### SuperWhisper → Raycast Workflow
```
1. Voice Input: "Create a draft about today's meeting notes"
2. SuperWhisper: Converts speech to text
3. Raycast: Processes natural language command
4. Drafts Extension: Creates draft with parsed content
5. Result: New draft created and opened
```

### Multi-App Voice Workflows
```
Voice: "Find my note about the Johnson project and create a reminder to follow up tomorrow"
↓
1. Raycast Obsidian: Search for "Johnson project" note
2. Raycast Reminders: Create reminder "Follow up on Johnson project" for tomorrow
3. Response: "Found note and created reminder"
```

## Architectural Role in SSS

### As Coordination Hub
```
Your AI Agent → MCP Client → Raycast MCP Server → App Extensions
                           ↓
                    Voice Processing
                           ↓
                    SuperWhisper Integration
```

### Cross-App Orchestration
- **Single Interface**: Access all apps through one platform
- **Unified Voice**: Voice commands work across all integrated apps
- **AI Enhancement**: Natural language processing for complex requests
- **Workflow Automation**: Chain operations across multiple apps

## Integration Strategy

### Immediate Leverage (Available Now)
1. **Use existing extensions** for 90% of functionality
2. **Voice-driven workflows** through SuperWhisper integration
3. **MCP coordination** for custom operations

### Custom Development (Strategic Additions)
1. **Complex workflows**: Multi-app operations not covered by individual extensions
2. **AI enhancement**: More sophisticated natural language processing
3. **SSS-specific operations**: Custom business logic for information liberation

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Existing Extension Testing
- [ ] Test Drafts extension with voice workflow
- [ ] Verify Reminders natural language processing
- [ ] Test Obsidian search and creation operations
- [ ] Validate cross-app voice commands

### Phase 2: MCP Integration
- [ ] Configure custom MCP servers in Raycast
- [ ] Test MCP server discovery and registration
- [ ] Build bridges between Raycast and syndicate-js AI agent

### Phase 3: Enhanced Workflows
- [ ] Multi-app voice-driven workflows
- [ ] Complex triage operations across apps
- [ ] AI-enhanced content routing and organization

## Advantages for SSS

### Immediate Benefits
- **90% functionality exists**: No need to build basic integrations
- **Voice ready**: SuperWhisper integration already working
- **AI enhanced**: Natural language processing built-in
- **Proven reliability**: Extensions are tested by community

### Strategic Benefits
- **Ecosystem leverage**: Benefit from community development
- **Future-proof**: New app integrations added by others
- **Reduced maintenance**: Core functionality maintained by Raycast/community
- **Focus on value-add**: Build orchestration, not basic operations

## Limitations & Workarounds

### Known Limitations
- **App-specific constraints**: Limited by underlying app APIs
- **Extension quality**: Varies across community extensions  
- **Custom logic**: Complex business rules require custom development

### Workarounds
- **MCP bypass**: Direct app integration when Raycast limitations hit
- **Warp integration**: System-level operations for advanced needs
- **Custom extensions**: Build SSS-specific Raycast extensions when needed
