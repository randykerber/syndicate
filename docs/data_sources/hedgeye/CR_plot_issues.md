# Issues with CR (Combined Ranges) plots

For any data point, for what day should it be in the plot.

### Trend Ranges

For Trend Ranges, what date ranges? Friday to Friday?

would prefer just disjointed horizontal lines.
Trend should project from Sunday thru Saturday.

If new add to EP portfolio, the Trend Range initially shows up as a vertical line.
Ideally, project it forward a day.

### Risk Ranges

date = today or yesterday?

Criteria for excluding Ticker?

EWG -- no RR

EWA -- a new add, TR is a faint vertical line.

FXB -- no RR, proxy = GBP/USD

GLD -- no RR, proxy = same as AAAU, TR = vertical line

GREK -- no longer in EP

IEF -- if no new TR, then should end TR ranges after 6-7 days

LQD -- exact same TR as last week?

WOOD -- indicate it's a short

PINK -- now RR, proxy = XLV
