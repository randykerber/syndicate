# SiloSlayer Missions

## Mission Overview

The SiloSlayer Syndicate's core mission is liberating information from "app prisons" through intelligent AI agent coordination.

## Primary Targets

### The 1219 Problem (Drafts Backlog)
**Challenge**: 1219+ unprocessed notes scattered in universal capture system
**Agent Mission**: AI-assisted triage with human decision support
**Workflow**:
1. Agent analyzes batch of recent captures
2. Provides smart routing suggestions with confidence scores
3. Human approves/overrides routing decisions  
4. Agent executes multi-tool operations to route content

### Universal Router Pattern
**Challenge**: New information needs instant, intelligent routing
**Agent Mission**: Real-time content categorization and routing
**Workflow**:
1. Content arrives via voice, text, or capture
2. ContentRouter agent analyzes content type and context
3. Agent determines destination with confidence scoring
4. High confidence → direct routing, Low confidence → human choice
5. Agent executes routing via appropriate native tools

## Agent-Human Collaboration Patterns

### Disambiguation Workflow
```
User: "Save this Springfield weather info"
Agent: "I found 3 Springfields. Which one?"
Human: "Illinois" 
Agent: "Routing to Obsidian Main > Weather > Illinois section"
```

### Content Enhancement Workflow  
```
User: "Fed will pivot at 4.5% unemployment"
Agent: "Should I enhance this with source context?"
Human: "Yes, link to Luke Gromen analysis"
Agent: "Enhanced and saved to Financial Analysis vault"
```

## Mission Success Metrics

### Immediate Wins
- **Backlog Growth Rate**: Reduce from 50+/month to 5-10/month
- **Routing Accuracy**: >90% of suggestions accepted by human
- **Response Time**: <30 seconds from capture to routing decision

### Long-term Liberation  
- **Cross-App Search**: Find content regardless of storage location
- **Intelligent Notifications**: Right information, right time, right place
- **Context Preservation**: Enhanced content with links and relationships

## English as Programming Language

All mission instructions use natural language rather than rigid code:

```
"Save as episode note, link to Luke Gromen, clean up language, preserve quotes"
"Route financial content to Main Vault, MP section, link to existing analysis"  
"Enhance with source URL, add tags for podcast and economics"
```

This approach allows rapid mission adaptation without code changes.
