## 🎯 Your Decision on Nov 24

### Option A: AI-First ($389/year)
- **Cursor Pro**: $240/year
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: $149/year
- **Total**: $389/year (+$210 vs. current)
- **Use**: Cursor for Python/JS greenfield, IntelliJ for Scala

**Choose if**: Cursor trial shows 30-40% productivity gains for Python/JS

### Option B: Traditional ($179/year)
- **JetBrains All Products Pack**: $179/year (current)
- **Total**: $179/year (no change)
- **Use**: IntelliJ/PyCharm for all work, Claude Code alongside

**Choose if**: Cursor doesn't impress or you need more evaluation time

### Option C: Minimal ($149/year)
- **IntelliJ IDEA only**: $149/year
- **Total**: $149/year (-$30 vs. current)
- **Use**: IntelliJ for Scala, free tools (VS Code/Cursor free tier) for Python/JS

**Choose if**: Realize you don't need DataGrip/DataSpell, and free Python/JS tools suffice

## 🚀 Next Steps (When You Return)

### Immediate (5 min)
1. Read `docs/cursor-quick-start.md` (this is your starting point)
2. Install Cursor: `brew install --cask cursor`
3. Open Syndicate: `cursor ~/gh/randykerber/syndicate`

### First Hour
1. Select Python interpreter (`.venv`)
2. Install Python extension
3. Try Chat, Inline Edit, Tab (see quick-start.md)
4. Open `cursor-vs-jetbrains-evaluation.md` and fill in Day 1

### This Week
- Use Cursor for ALL Python/JS work
- Process EPP email using Cursor when it arrives (KEY TEST)
- Track experience daily (5 min/day)
- Test Composer on multi-file task

### Nov 24
- Score your experience (0-15 points)
- Make decision: Option A, B, or C
- Renew/purchase chosen option

## 📊 What Success Looks Like

### Strong Yes to Cursor (Option A)
- AI autocomplete saves 10+ min/day
- Composer handles complex refactors well
- You rarely miss JetBrains tools
- Learning Python/JS feels faster
- Willing to pay $240/year for these benefits

### Needs More Time (Option B)
- Cursor is helpful but not transformative
- Still adjusting to workflow
- Missing some JetBrains features significantly
- Want another year to evaluate

### Not for You (Option B or C)
- Cursor slows you down
- AI suggestions create more bugs than they solve
- Constantly wishing for JetBrains
- VS Code paradigm doesn't fit your brain

## 💡 Research Summary (From Earlier)

### Cursor v2.0 Strengths
- **Composer**: 4x faster than similar models, <30 sec most tasks
- **Agent-first UI**: Multi-agent parallel work, git worktrees
- **User reports**: 30-40% productivity gains average
- **Speed gains**: Real for boilerplate, refactoring, unfamiliar code

### Cursor v2.0 Challenges
- ~15% subtle bugs (still need code review)
- Doesn't perform well on VERY large projects
- Sometimes changes code you didn't ask for

### JetBrains AI Assistant (2024-2025)
- Playing catch-up, not AI-native
- "Reviews for existing AI Assistant are poor" (DevClass)
- Recently added multi-file editing, Junie agent
- Better than nothing, but not in same league as Cursor

### Verdict from Research
"JetBrains is not in the game. They're trying, but fundamentally retrofitting AI into traditional IDE. Cursor was built for AI-first era."

## 🎓 Key Insight

The question isn't "Is Cursor better than JetBrains?"

The question is: **"For YOUR workflow (Python/JS greenfield + learning), is Cursor's AI-first approach worth $240/year?"**

Only one way to find out: **Real work for a week.**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **No approval needed for trial** - All setup is done, just install and use
2. **Free trial works** - Don't need to pay until you decide
3. **JetBrains still installed** - Can switch back anytime
4. **Track honestly** - Don't force yourself to like it if it's not working
5. **Nov 24 is firm** - JetBrains renewal date, make decision by then

## 🙋 Questions I Anticipated

**Q: Do I need to sign up for Cursor Pro now?**
A: No. Free tier works for trial. Only pay if you choose Option A on Nov 24.

**Q: What if I can't decide by Nov 24?**
A: Renew JetBrains All Products Pack (Option B), continue Cursor free tier, re-evaluate in 2026.

**Q: Can I use both during trial?**
A: You CAN, but won't get honest evaluation. Force yourself to use ONLY Cursor for Python/JS this week.

**Q: What about Scala?**
A: Keep using IntelliJ for Scala. Cursor trial is for Python/JS only.

**Q: I hate it after 2 days. Should I continue?**
A: Give it 3-4 days (learning curve is real). If still hate it by day 5, you have your answer.

## ✨ Final Thought

You're in a great position:
- Hedgeye pipeline is complete and working
- Perfect time for a fresh start with new tool
- Clear decision framework
- 1 week to evaluate risk-free
- Real deadline forcing honest decision

**Trust your gut. If Cursor feels like the future, go for it. If it feels like hype, stick with JetBrains.**

Now go install Cursor and start your trial! 🚀
