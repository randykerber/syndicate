## Machine Migration History

### Migration: idlewood → rstudio (November 2025)

**Status**: COMPLETE ✓

**Details**:
- **From**: idlewood (2019 MacBook Pro)
- **To**: rstudio (Mac Studio, M4 Max)
- **Approach**: Clean install, selective migration (no Migration Assistant)
- **Reason**: Avoid carrying over cruft and issues from old machine

**Completed Setup**:
- [x] Claude Desktop configuration
- [x] Claude Code setup
- [x] Development environments (Python with uv, Scala)
- [x] Editor configurations (Cursor, IntelliJ)
- [x] Active project repositories
- [x] App configurations (Raycast, Obsidian)
- [x] Warp terminal set as default
- [x] Python environment with uv
- [x] Cursor Pro subscription
- [x] IntelliJ IDEA (longtime customer discount)
- [x] Obsidian Sync configured across all devices
- [x] Syndicate project (merged hedgeye-kb into it)

**Sync Strategy**:
- **Code**: Git repositories (primary sync method)
- **Documents**: iCloud / Google Drive
- **Notes**: Obsidian Sync (works seamlessly across all devices)
- **Not syncing**: Build artifacts, temp files, large datasets

## Editor Choice Decision

### Current Setup (Decided)

**Active Subscriptions**:
- **Cursor Pro**: $20/month - For Python/JS work with AI-assisted coding
- **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate**: $119/year (longtime customer discount) - Primary for Scala, secondary for Python/JS
- **Total Annual Cost**: $359/year ($20×12 + $119)

**Decision Rationale**:
- Cursor's Composer mode valuable for Python/JS development
- IntelliJ excellent for Scala refactoring and enterprise development
- PyCharm no longer needed (IntelliJ handles Python)
- Claude Code available in all environments as supplementary AI assistance

**Retired Tools**:
- ~~PyCharm~~ (removed, IntelliJ handles Python)
- ~~JetBrains All Products Pack~~ (switched to IntelliJ only)

## Memory Bank Philosophy

Context files serve as:
- **Context** for conversations across sessions
- **Preferences** for how Randy works
- **History** of setup journey and decisions
- **Reference** for future sessions

Keep them updated, keep them accurate, keep them useful.
