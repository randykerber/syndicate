## Questions for Claude Section

From CLAUDE.md:

"## Questions for Claude

If something is unclear or needs more information:
- Ask rather than assume
- Clarify requirements before acting
- Confirm major changes before executing
- Explain reasoning for suggestions"

**Reason for exclusion**: Already covered in "When Uncertain" section of COMMON.md.

---

## Summary

Most excluded content falls into these categories:
1. **Duplicates** - Same info with different phrasing across files
2. **Examples** - General programming examples, not specific to workflows
3. **Meta-instructions** - Instructions about maintaining the context files themselves
4. **Test artifacts** - Verification codes/tests
5. **Too granular** - Project-specific code patterns better kept in actual code

**If anything here seems valuable, it can be rescued and added to the appropriate file.**
